## 📌Project Background
I created this interactive dashboard as both a practice project and a portfolio piece to apply descriptive statistics and data visualization skills. The dataset used is the Superstore dataset, which contains retail sales transaction data from across the United States.
The main objective of this project is to visualize sales and profit performance over time, helping managers analyze business performance more efficiently.
The dashboard is designed to be interactive—users can choose to focus the analysis on either sales or profit and year selection, and all visual elements will dynamically adjust based on that selection.

## 🧾Executive Summary
This dashboard provides a business performance summary across several key metrics:
1. KPI cards covering total sales, total profit, total number of orders, and total number of customers.
2. Identification of top-performing segments, categories, subcategories, and individual products.
3. Exploration of sales and profit trends over time (on a weekly basis).
4. Geographic distribution of sales and profit visualized through a map view

With interactive filters for sales/profit and year selection, users can tailor the analysis perspective according to their specific needs.
