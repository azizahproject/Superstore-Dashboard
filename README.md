## 📌Project Background
I created this interactive dashboard as both a practice project and a portfolio piece to apply descriptive statistics and data visualization skills. The dataset used is the Superstore dataset, which contains retail sales transaction data from across the United States.
The main objective of this project is to visualize sales and profit performance over time, helping managers analyze business performance more efficiently.
The dashboard is designed to be interactive—users can choose to focus the analysis on either sales or profit and year selection, and all visual elements will dynamically adjust based on that selection.

## 🧾Executive Summary
This dashboard provides a business performance summary across several key metrics:
1. KPI cards covering total sales, total profit, total number of orders, and total number of customers.
2. Identification of top-performing segments, categories, subcategories, and individual products.
3. Exploration of sales and profit trends over time (on a weekly basis).
4. Geographic distribution of sales and profit visualized through a map view

With interactive filters for sales/profit and year selection, users can tailor the analysis perspective according to their specific needs.

## 🔍 Insights Deep-Dive
### 📊 Customer Segment & Product Category
1. The Consumer segment contributes the most to both sales and profit.
2. The Technology category outperforms other categories in terms of both sales and profit.

### 🔝 Sub-Category & Top Products
1. Sub-categories such as Phones and Chairs consistently rank at the top in both sales and profit.
2. Several products with high sales volume do not necessarily generate high profit, indicating potential margin issues.

### 🌍 Geographical Performance
1. States such as California and New York show the strongest performance in both sales and profit.
2. The map provides a clear geographic overview of business performance across U.S. states, helping identify high- and low-performing regions.

### 📈 Trend Over Time
1. Sales trends form a consistent bell-shaped pattern each month, with a noticeable sales peak occurring around the third or fourth week.
2. This recurring monthly peak suggests strong seasonality in customer purchasing behavior, possibly driven by end-of-month promotions or purchasing cycles.
3. In terms of profit, several weeks within the dataset recorded negative values. However, a year-over-year comparison shows that the frequency of negative-profit weeks has gradually decreased.
